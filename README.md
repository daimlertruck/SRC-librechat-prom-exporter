# librechat-prom-exporter
This project uses Express, Mongoose, and prom-client to connect to your LibreChat MongoDB, collect basic metrics (like user, message, and conversation counts), and expose them on a /metrics endpoint for Prometheus to scrape. You can expand and adjust the models and queries as needed for your full LibreChat data model.
